You've come across this code, which prints the total number of rooms owned by the present king:

```php
<?php

$king = 'King Balon the 6th';
print_r($king . ' has ' . (6 * 17) . ' rooms.');
```

As you can see, there are some magic numbers here: it's unclear what 6 is and what 17 is. If you know the history of the royal family, you can guess: each new king inherits all his ancestors' castles and builds a new one, an exact copy of his parents'.

This strange dynasty simply breeds identical castlesâ€¦

Get rid of the magic numbers by creating new variables and then displaying the text on the screen.

You'll get this:

<pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>
King Balon the 6th has 102 rooms.
</pre>

Variable names should convey the meaning of numbers, but should remain short and succinct enough to be easily read.

Note: The code will work with any name, and we only check the printed result, so the task is up to you.
