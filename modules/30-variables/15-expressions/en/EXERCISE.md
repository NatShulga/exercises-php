Write a program that takes the original number of euros from the `$eurosCount` variable, converts euros to dollars, and displays the value on the screen. Then the program converts the received value into yuans and displays the result on a new line.

Example output for 100 euros:

```
125
863.75
```

For the purposes of the exercise, we'll say that:
- 1 euro = $1.25 
- 1 dollar = 6.91 yuans
