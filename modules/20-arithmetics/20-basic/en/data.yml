name: Arithmetic Operations
tips:
  - >
    Always indent arithmetic operators with spaces between the numbers
    (operands). It's good form when programming. Therefore, in our examples, we
    have `print_r(3 + 4)` rather than `print_r(3+4)`.
  - >
    Dividing by zero causes, unsurprisingly, a `Division by zero` error. To
    avoid it, you need to know about conditional constructs (you'll learn about
    them in future
  - |
    Type your code between the`// BEGIN` and `// END` lines in the editor.
