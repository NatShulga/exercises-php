Complete the implementation of the `getYear()` function, which returns the year of the timestamp passed:

Call examples:

```php
<?php

getYear(1532435204); // 2018
```

* To round down, use the  [floor()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.floor.php)
* Don't forget to convert the resulting number to the `int` type
