Write a function, `generateAmount()`, that takes two numbers: the number of items and the cost of an audit. If there are 0 goods, the function returns the cost of the audit multiplied by 3. If there aren't 0 goods, the function returns the number of goods.

Call examples:

```php
<?php

generateAmount(0, 2);   // 6
generateAmount(0, 5);   // 15
generateAmount(1, 2);   // 1
generateAmount(12, 49); // 12
```
