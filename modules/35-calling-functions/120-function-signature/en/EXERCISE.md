Now it's your turn, look at the signature of a function in the documentation and work out how to use it. Now it's your turn to find the function signature in the documentation and figure out how to use it.

In PHP, there's a function called `ucfirst()`. Study its signature at [https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ucfirst.php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ucfirst.php).

Write a program that uses `ucfirst()` with the variable `$text` and displays the result. The value of the `$text` variable is already defined.
