Implement a function called `getAge()`, which rounds down someone's age. That is, if a person is ten and a half years old, the function should return `10`.

Use the standard `floor()` function, which rounds down the number.

```php
<?php

getAge(10);  // 10.0
getAge(9.1); // 9.0
getAge(8.9); // 8.0
```
